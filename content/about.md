Hello, My name is Steven or also known as "r4nc0x". I graduated with a technical bachelor's degree and decided to focus on what I like most, which is computer security.

I started practicing independently using everything I had at my disposal such as the internet and books, until I decided to enter a hacking academy [Hack4u](https://hack4u.io/).

Currently I am going to start training with the tool [HackTheBox (HTB)](https://www.hackthebox.com/).
