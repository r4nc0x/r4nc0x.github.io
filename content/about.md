Hello, my name is Steven, also known as **r4nc0x**.

I am a cybersecurity-oriented professional focused on **Pentesting and Red Teaming**. I currently have over one year of professional experience working in technical support, where I strengthened my knowledge in infrastructure, operating systems, networking, and incident resolution.

My transition into offensive security began through self-study, leveraging technical documentation, hands-on labs, and specialized resources. I later formalized my training at **Hack4u**, where I developed strong foundations in Linux, networking, exploitation techniques, and ethical hacking methodologies.

I am currently continuing my practical training on **Hack The Box (HTB)**, sharpening my skills in enumeration, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation within controlled environments.

My professional goal is to establish myself as a **Pentester**, specializing in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and attack simulation in corporate environments.
